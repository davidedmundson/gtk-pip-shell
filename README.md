# GTK Picutre in Picture Shell

A library to write [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) applications that use https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/132

# Current state

The protocol is not upstream. Do not land any patches that require this. However we do need to use the protocol to make sure we make something that actually works for real life.
